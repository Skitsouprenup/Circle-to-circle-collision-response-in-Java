# Circle-to-circle-collision-response-in-Java
Collision response between two circles.

If you wanna know how to detect collision between two circles then watch this tutorial of mine first: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SnQp1aKVExc&t=0s

This projects demonstrates different ways of separating two circles that collide with each other. First off, I'm gonna start explaining the first method which is the slowest in comparison with the other two methods. After that, I'm gonna explain the latter.

Viewers are expected to have an understanding of Java GUI concepts and knowledgeable about trigonometry and vector math.
