# Circle-to-circle-collision-response-in-Java
Collision response between two circles.

If you don't know how to detect collision between two circles then watch this tutorial of mine first:

This project is explained in this tutorial of mine: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5HdWAg6Xod0

This project demonstrates different ways of separating two circles that collide with each other. First off, I'm gonna start explaining the first method which is the slowest in comparison with the other two methods. After that, I'm gonna explain the latter.

Viewers are expected to have an understanding of Java GUI concepts and knowledgeable about trigonometry and vector math.

The 'Complete' directory contains UI codes and collision algorithms. The 'Setup' directory contains UI codes and doesn't contain circle-to-circle collision response algorithm. Use the files in 'Complete' folder for your reference and use files in 'Setup' folder if you wanna follow my tutorial that I mentioned above.
